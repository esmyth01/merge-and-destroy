<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I grew up in central Michigan. I graduated from the University of Michigan in 2008
with a BA. I enjoy many different activities but the ones I love most
usually involve the <strong>outdoors</strong>. In particular I love to fly fish and
downhill ski. I moved to Seattle in 2008, and absolutely love it out
here. The people, the culture, and outdoor lifestyle coincide perfectly
with my personality.</p>

<h3>Why I'm Taking This Class</h3>

<p>I moved out to Seattle shortly after graduating from UofM in 2008.
Fresh out of college with a new degree in hand, I figured it would be no
problem finding a good salary job. Jobs were few and pay was minimal, and after bouncing around in many
different fields of work, I said enough is enough and decided to go back to school.
After many sleepless nights spent researching and second-guessing myself, I elected to give
the <em>web development</em> program a try at SCCC. I'm really excited about what it offers. I'm hoping that upon completion, I will be
able to land a good job with a good salary. My fingers are crossed.</p>
